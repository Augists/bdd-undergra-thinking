# BDD Variable Order Thinking

## Problem Set

1. **create** variable order
   - `createVar` and `ithVar`
2. **construct** variable order
   - `apply` operation

## Start

Open the project in IDEA. (`/.idea` is preserved for plugin `google-java-format` and other settings)

Generate dataset by

```shell
python3 utils/randomCreateIP.py
```

which is a random IP address generator and will store all IPs in `src/main/resources/org/ants/ips`

Then run the main code in java.

## Result

The mkcount of creating variables constructing 1000 IPs  forward and reverse. Total run time is roughly related to mkcount but the specific value is unstable. For same data ,total run time differs each time, so the listed total run time is the average of 10 times.

| mkcount           | create-rev | create-for |
|:-----------------:| ---------- | ---------- |
| **construct-rev** | 1111699    | 26146      |
| **construct-for** | 1005654    | 121957     |

| total run time    | create-rev | create-for |
|:-----------------:| ---------- | ---------- |
| **construct-rev** | 181602000  | 9247100    |
| **construct-for** | 151002200  | 22744400   |

From the result we can see that mkcount and total run time follow the same situation: Creating variables forward is obviouly faster than reverse, and for construct, using the opposite order to create is faster.

## Why

#### #1 Create

Encoding the IP address can be done in two ways: one where the highest bit of the IP is x0 and the lowest bit is x31, and another where the highest bit is x31 and the lowest bit is x0. During assembly, there is not much difference between these two encoding methods, and the shape and structure of the BDD (Binary Decision Diagram) remain largely the same. Therefore, the difference in overhead is not reflected at this stage.

Some IP addresses are 16 bits, while others are 32 bits. If the IP address is only 16 bits, when encoding in the forward direction, the indices x16 to x32 do not correspond to any values in the IP address, and x15 will directly point to the terminal. In the apply function, the BDD is constructed starting from the highest-priority bit, and the two BDDs are recursively processed. If one BDD reaches the terminal and the final value can be computed, the recursion ends.

When performing an OR operation on all IP addresses, a forward-encoded BDD will directly reach the terminal after recursing to x15. If the result is already 1 (for an OR operation, 1 OR any value is 1), the recursion will not continue. However, in reverse encoding, for a 16-bit IP address, only bits starting from x16 are valid. Therefore, when performing an OR operation between a 32-bit and a 16-bit IP address, the recursion will start from x0 for the 32-bit IP address and only become valid for the 16-bit IP address when it reaches x16. This wastes a significant amount of recursion time, leading to differences in time overhead.

For more details, you can see the pdf in the supplement.

#### #2 Construct

When create variables in the same order, constructing the bdd in the opposite order of creating brings less mkcount. The reason is related to the  inner order of operation "and". (For both reverse and forward, the final bdd of a single IP is the same due to we have same createvar order, so the "or" opreation of different bdd for both situation should be the same, so we can just talk about "and")

The "and" operation begins with the roots of two bdds, if the vars of two roots are different, it recursively goes deeper of the one who has lower var. For the reverse case, each time the new node to be added to the bdd always has the  lowest var, so it go deeper and dirtctly get to terminal 1 and 0, then we can directly put the bdd below the new var regardless of what's exacly in the bdd. Unfortunately when in forward case, the new node always has the highest var, so each time adding a new node, the "and" operation has to recursive go through the whole bdd till it get to the end, add the node, and then recursive go back to the root. so in the forward order, it watse a lot of time going through the bdd, which is  unnecessary because we know each time the new node( or bdd) is just a node directly attach to the terminal.

I didn't mention operation cache above, but the influence of it to the difference is ignorable if the IPs are random.   The two situation have their own order and the corresponding cache, each one has better performance depends on the pattern of IP data.

## Lib

`/lib/jdd-111.jar` is a [modified version](https://github.com/Augists/jdd) of [jdd library](https://bitbucket.org/vahidi/jdd) with variable `mkCount`.
